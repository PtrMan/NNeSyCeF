Roadmap
===

Q&A
====

* implement basic Q&A
* find better answers
* (advanced) structural queries with SDR's

* fast and efficient handling of sets with parent-questions

Attention
====

* ~~implement basic attributes for tasks~~
* implement concept with custom strategy

Inference
====

* implement most rules
* unifier

Procedural
====

* implement decision making
* implement procedural learning and representation from ANSNA

* implement sequence mapping and query with SDR's
   * <(&/, a, +5) =/> b> and <(&/, a, +15) =/> b> are specializations of a =/> b
     this can be represented in a SDR (for a fast lookup) and a symbolic representation (for symbolic manipulation)
