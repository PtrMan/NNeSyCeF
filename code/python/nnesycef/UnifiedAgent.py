>>> Temporal induction between a (all events in the FIFO) and b happens, 

(me)
this doesn't make any sense to me
it just spams the system with derivations
it would be fine if the derivations would be filtered like in event buffer
by relative frequency (where frequency is a float which is incremented by 1.0 when seen and slowly decays)
hm this makes sense - it is like my compression idea (for events) but works in realtime (without a delay because of the fifo for compressed candidates)
I may implement it this way
